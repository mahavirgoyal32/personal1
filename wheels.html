On the other side, the book explores the creation story of Sun temple, where the king Narasingha Dev Who is a dedicated admirer of architect wants to build something unique. The main purpose of the Sun temple is to cure leprosy. 1200 people and Shilpi were summoned to build this temple in the span of 12 years.
