	<h1> Poor Economics</h1>
	<h3>
		Chapter 1: Introduction — Think Again, Again

Global poverty should not be viewed a single amorphous problem, but rather the combined result of many discrete problems. We should focus on addressing these individual problems.

Many economists debate the extent to which poverty traps may exist. The authors define a poverty trap as:

“There will be a poverty trap whenever the scope for growing income or wealth at a very fast rate is limited for those who have too little to invest, but expands dramatically for those who can invest a bit more. On the other hand, if the potential for fast growth is high among the poor, and then tapers off as one gets richer, there is no poverty trap.”

Anti-poverty approaches should be based on research and data such as randomized controlled trials. Lazy thinking (being constrained by ideology, ignorance and inertia) is the enemy of progress.

Chapter 2: Food and Nutrition — A Billion Hungry People?

While lack of food can still be a problem in specific instances, in modern society it is not a contributor to the general persistence of poverty. A major exception is malnutrition in utero and during childhood, which correlates with lifetime education attained and future wages earned. In these cases anti-malnutrition programs like iodine supplementation for pregnant mothers and deworming pills for youth have demonstrated substantial value. Malnutrition in adults living in extreme poverty has a much less direct effect on wages, but one exception is anemia (extreme iron deficiency).

The poor, like everyone, are skeptical of others telling them what to eat. Also like everyone, the poor prioritize spending that make life less boring (TV, cell phones, cultural events, tastier but nutritionally low-value food, etc). Finally, nutrition education is challenging because the personal experience feedback loop takes a long time — investment in childhood nutrition doesn’t financially pay off until years later in adult life.

Chapter 3: Healthcare — Low-Hanging Fruit for Better (Global) Health?

Health poverty traps affect the extreme poor. Children who are sick go to school less and earn less over the course of their lifetimes. While the poor spend considerable time and money on healthcare, it is most often on expensive cures rather than cheap preventative care.

Additionally, a lack of education about health has the side effect of creating a tendency to overmedicate and thus propagate drug-resistant pathogens. People view doctors who prescribe medication or give a shot as effective doctors.

There are a number of reasons why preventative care is under-utilized: Facilities may be closed, biological concepts of vaccination and preventative treatments require education, and people tend to procrastinate (time inconsistency). Research suggests that substantial gains in outcomes from a health program can be made simply by making the “right” decision the default decision (for example, only requiring additional action if participants wish to opt out). Also it can be worth it to provide additional incentives to overcome procrastination (for example free food as a reward for getting the next shot in a vaccination sequence).

Chapter 4: Education — Top of the Class

Low education attainment is not due to lack of schools. Enrollment rates are improving, but current challenges include poor quality of education and students dropping out of school.

In poor countries, education outcomes are significantly better in private schools, where teacher absenteeism is much lower. One-on-one tutoring and summer camps have also demonstrated significant education quality gains.

Rich countries keep students in school by requiring that they attend until a specific age. Developing countries don’t have the capacity to enforce this, thus other interventions are required. Unconditional cash transfers have been shown to increase enrollment rates (interestingly at the same rate as conditional cash transfers). Also, explaining to parents that income returns increase proportionally with each additional year of education — for students from backgrounds similar to their own — has been useful in preventing parents from pooling resources behind one child while their remaining children discontinue further education.

As with education everywhere, parent, teacher, and student perceptions of what the student is able to achieve strongly correlate with learning outcomes.

Chapter 5: Family Planning and Contraceptives — Pak Sudarno’s Big Family

Governments of poor countries often consider family planning a central component to development strategy. While there are clear environmental downsides to large families, there is no research consensus that children in large families have a worse quality of life than children in smaller families. However, parents living in poverty may be incentivized to have a large family as their children’s future adult wages represent an important lifeline once the parents are no longer able to work.

Husbands, family and the culture of a community have a large effect on a woman’s ability to procure contraceptives. Families are defined by specific social roles, which can be slow to evolve and are resistant to change. The authors posit that instead of attempting to address high fertility by changing family dynamics, high fertility rates may be more easily addressed by the creation of stronger social safety nets, which could reduce incentive for parents to have large families.

Interestingly, the availability of contraceptives hasn’t been correlated with lower community fertility rates. Contraceptives and family planning programs have been shown, however, to help teenagers delay pregnancy. Teenage pregnancy rates are very high in developing countries and (in addition to health risks) directly impact their ability to stay in school, get more education and earn more over the course of their lives. Unfortunately, teenagers may have the greatest unmet need for for family planning and contraceptives because many countries prohibit teenage access to family planning without consent of their parents.

Programs promoting abstinence as strategy to avoid HIV have been measured to have no significant effect on teenage pregnancy rates, possibly because many poor teens get pregnant (and contract HIV) from older men — a decision that is likely economic need-based. Programs that educate teenagers about getting HIV from older men and programs that provide financial assistance to stay in school have shown reduced pregnancy rates. The authors conclude that teenagers, like adults, make conscious decisions about when to get pregnant. A pregnancy from an older man may provide financial stability down the road. If there are opportunities to stay in school, teenagers are less incentivized to get pregnant in pursuit of maximizing their economic potential.

Chapter 6: Financial Risk — Barefoot Hedge-Fund Managers

Regional economic disruptions may not impact the extreme poor to the same extent that they impact the general economy because the extreme poor are already living on the absolute margin.

However because of their level of exposure, local economic disruptions such as a family’s unexpected health emergency can set the poor back substantially — especially if their ability to earn more wealth depends on current wealth (having daily credit available to buy and sell goods, for example).

While the poor are often forced to rely on wildly fluctuating sources of income like non-irrigated farms and day labor work, they limit exposure to any one risk by diversifying their income portfolio (agricultural earnings, seeking work in urban areas, microenterprise, tenant farming, large family, etc). However, this has the effect of preventing occupational specialization (and skill-building).

The psychological effect of the poor’s constant financial risk is high stress, which has been shown to impair focus and reduce productivity.

In an attempt to reduce risk, microfinance institutions have experimented with offering health insurance, but the extreme poor may not be willing to pay the required premiums at the cost of tying up cash. Subsidized insurance from governments could reduce risk exposure while also dropping premiums to a level that the poor are willing (and able) to pay.

Chapter 7: Interest Rates and Credit — The Men from Kabul and the Eunuchs of India

The poor pay very high interest rates, in part because determining the creditworthiness of the poor is time-consuming (and expensive), creditors have very limited options for recovering capital after default, and while interest rates are extremely high, net returns per account are still relatively low. It is also for these reasons that the poor rarely have access to banks and instead most often have to rely on money lenders, their community, or microcredit for a loan.

Microcredit offers better interest rates than money lenders, but in comparison, its rigid borrower repayment structure means less flexibility with future cash. Microcredit has reached hundreds of millions, and while its effect has not been revolutionarily transformative, it has demonstrated positive gains. Enterprises that receive microcredit loans rarely grow beyond one employee. There is currently a funding gap for medium-scale enterprises that are still too small for banks but too large for money lenders.

Chapter 8: Saving Wealth — Saving Brick by Brick

The poor recognize the challenge of keeping cash on-hand and also the necessity of saving money. Having difficulty saving money isn’t necessarily a symptom of frivolous spending — rather, for those living on the absolute margins, by definition there are always necessities that they lack. The poor use non-traditional ways to save including partially building a house brick-by-brick, savings clubs, and storing extra money with money lenders.

While the poor generally aren’t profitable for banks (the per-account administrative costs are too high for the low deposit amount), research shows that when the poor have access to affordable savings accounts, they are able to save more than they otherwise would.

However, establishing savings for the poor isn’t just a technical challenge of creating affordable savings products. For the extreme poor and poor everywhere, it is hard to stay motivated to save when it seems that improving one’s life will be impossible. Thus, for many who may not have encountered examples of how long-term savings can change one’s life, it can make more sense to them to prioritize purchases that will improve life today. The perception that opportunity exists is paramount to success in savings.

Chapter 9: Economic Paths to the Middle Class — Reluctant Entrepreneurs

While the marginal returns (return per dollar of investment) of microenterprise investments can exceed 50%, the businesses themselves are very small and overall returns are quite small. In many cases these businesses do not last more than five years and rarely grow beyond one employee.

Additionally, this means that it may be decades of steady reinvestment before one accrues the necessary funds to purchase a technology that might significantly expand production or business. Knowing this, it can be almost impossible for the extreme poor to believe they’ll be able to change their circumstances and therefore attempt to venture down the path of growth.

Many of the extreme poor see the path to prosperity being through their children getting a salaried government job — not via a small business. The long term stability these jobs afford offers the mental bandwidth and economic opportunity for long term planning and growth towards middle class.

Industrial growth has been shown to benefit the wages of the poor disproportionately.
Urban areas offer better job and education opportunities, but general reliance on the social safety net of one’s community means a move away can be difficult and risky. Better urban planning policy including public housing and improved safety nets can incentivize such moves and subsequent growth in wages of the poor.

Chapter 10: Conclusion and Key Findings — Policies, Politics

It’s often assumed that drastic political reforms are necessary to solve large problems. However, replacing a political institution can be very difficult or impossible. Instead, the authors believe that significant policy improvements can be made in the margins of existing institutions, which may in turn lead to better overall institutions, especially so if the new policies result in small wins and increase trust in existing governments. Greater trust in a government allows it to focus less on voters’ immediate approval and more on long-term gains. Small, non-controversial modifications can have big effects.

Governments exist to solve problems that the market is not able to. While there are many cases of inefficiency, inadequacy, or corruption, even mediocre policies (such as imperfect, rigged elections or no elections at all) can catalyse significant progress. Still, whenever possible lazy thinking in policy design (being constrained by ignorance, inertia or ideology) should be avoided.

In conclusion, the authors report five key findings. “The poor often lack critical pieces of information and believe things that are not true… The poor bear too much responsibility for their own lives (for the wealthy, the right decisions are often automatic)… There are good reasons that some markets are missing for the poor, or that they face unfavorable prices in them… Poor countries are not doomed to failure because they are poor, or because they have had an unfortunate history… Expectations about what people are able or unable to do all too often end up turning into self-fulfilling prophecies.”
